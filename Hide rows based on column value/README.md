# Hide or Show Rows Based on Value in Google Sheets

This Google Apps Script automates the process of hiding or showing rows in a Google Sheets document based on specific values in a designated column. The script allows you to hide rows where a cell meets a certain condition (e.g., if the value is `1` in a specific column) and show them if the condition is not met.

## Functionality

The `hideRowsBasedOnValue()` function performs the following tasks:

1. **Target Sheet**: It operates on a sheet named `Sheet1`. You can modify the sheet name within the script if you'd like to use it on a different sheet.
2. **Check Values in Column 23**: The function checks values in the 23rd column (Column W) of the sheet.
3. **Hide or Show Rows**: If a row contains a value of `1` in the 23rd column, the script hides that row. If the value is not `1`, the row will be shown.

## When to Use This Script

This script can be helpful in the following scenarios:

- **Data Filtering**: When you need to automatically hide or show rows based on specific conditions without manually filtering the data. For example, you can use this script to hide rows where the status of a task is marked as "completed" (represented by the value `1`).
- **Conditional Data Display**: If you want to focus on specific rows in a sheet, this script helps automate hiding irrelevant data based on conditions (e.g., only showing tasks that are "in-progress" and hiding those marked "done").
- **Data Review**: In scenarios where rows with certain values should be hidden from view for clarity or review purposes (e.g., hiding archived or completed entries).
