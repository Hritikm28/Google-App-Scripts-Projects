# Overview

This Google Apps Script dynamically applies background colors to entire rows in a Google Sheet based on the values in a specified column. It helps visually categorize or highlight rows, making it easier to interpret and review data.

## Functionality

The `colorRowsBasedOnColumnvalue()` function performs the following tasks:

1. **Target Sheet**: Operates on a sheet named `Sheet1`. You can modify the script to use a different sheet name.
2. **Check Column Values**: Scans all rows in the 22nd column (Column V) to determine the value.
3. **Apply Row Colors**:
   - If the cell value in the 22nd column is `1`, the row's background color is set to **green** (`#90EE90`).
   - If the cell value is `2`, the row's background color is set to **red** (`#FFCCCB`).
   - You can customize these colors and conditions as needed.

## Use Cases

This script is ideal for scenarios where you need to visually distinguish data in a Google Sheet based on specific conditions. Some practical applications include:

- **Task Management**: Highlight tasks based on priority or completion status. For example:
  - Green for completed tasks.
  - Red for tasks requiring urgent attention.
- **Project Tracking**: Color-code milestones based on their status (e.g., `1` for completed, `2` for delayed).
- **Student Grades**: Use colors to represent performance bands, such as high, medium, and low scores.
- **Inventory Management**: Highlight rows based on stock levels or reorder status.
